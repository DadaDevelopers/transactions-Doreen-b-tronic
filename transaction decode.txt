This transaction is a Segregated Witness (SegWit) transaction, which is identifiable by the 0001 marker immediately following the version. This format separates the transaction data (inputs/outputs) from the "witness" data (signatures/unlocking scripts)

Step 1: Version
Hex: 02000000
Little-endian → 0x00000002 → version = 2
4 bytes: Indicates transaction format version.

Step 2: SegWit Marker
Hex: 0001
00 → marker
01 → flag
Presence of these two bytes indicates SegWit transaction.

Step 3: Input Count
Hex: 01 → 1 input
VarInt: Number of inputs in the transaction.

Step 4: Input #0
Hex Segments and Meaning:
Hex Segment	Bytes	Meaning
31811cd355c357e0e01437d9bcf690df824e9ff785012b6115dfae3d8e8b36c1(32 bytes) which means revious txid (little-endian) → c1368b...3181
01000000(4 bytes) which means previous output index (vout) → 1
00(1 byte) which means scriptSig length → 0 (empty for P2WPKH input)
fdffffff(4 bytes)  which means sequence  of 0xfffffffd

Step 5: Output Count
Hex: 02 → 2 outputs
VarInt indicating number of outputs.

Step 6: Output #0
Hex Segments:
Hex Segment	Bytes	Meaning
20a1070000000000(8 bytes) which means value in satoshis is in little-endian of 100,000,000 sats equals to 1 BTC
16 (1 byte)	which means scriptPubKey length  is equal to 22 bytes
001485d78eb795bd9c8a21afefc8b6fdaedf71836809	22	ScriptPubKey → P2WPKH (SegWit)

Step 7: Output #1
Hex Segments:
Hex Segment	Bytes	Meaning
4c08100000000000(8 bytwa) which is the value in satoshis equal to 1,000,000 sats that is 0.01 BTC
16(1 byte) which is the ScriptPubKey length of 22 bytes

Step 8: Witness Data
For Input #0:
Hex Segment	Meaning
02 (2 bytes) This are the witness items
47304402207bce86...	Signature 1 → DER signature with sighash byte at end
210260828b...	Public key → 33-byte compressed public key
Each item has a VarInt length.
Shows the unlocking data for the SegWit input.

Step 9: Locktime
Hex: 00000000 (4 bytes )  which is the locktime = 0
Transaction can be included immediately in a block.
